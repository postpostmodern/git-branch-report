# git-branch-report

An oh-my-zsh plugin for viewing statuses of branches

To use this, clone the repo into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`

```zsh
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/postpostmodern/git-branch-report
```

And then edit your `.zshrc` file and add `git-branch-report` to your oh my zsh plugins.

## Icon Issues

I'm still working on getting the icons working across different configurations. Right now, it only works with Nerd Fonts
